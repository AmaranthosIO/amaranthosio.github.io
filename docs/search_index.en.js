encapsulation system based on Functional Reactive Programming and Event Sourcing.\n\n\nThe universe is made of events not objects - Carlo Rovelli\n\nIn less than a few centuries, our information devices have exploded from 1, our brain, to a few in books and physical objects, to thousands of digital and analog sources over our lifetimes. We need to participate in a world that is demanding more and more from us in order just to participate. \nWe need more knowledge, faster, more often, just to interact with our already stored and processed information. And it just keeps growing. From 2020 to 2025 it will grow from 64 to 180 zettabytes. Computing today requires lots of information and a way to interchange it effectively, lest you will be the interchange. We need a standard way to connect it, relate it and query it.\nWe want a Composable Information Machine.\n\nExpect several Sources of Truth connected to several Systems of Record with a secure peer-to-peer network where we control the peers and the channels.\nIncorporate information decisions into our daily lives\nCurrently we spend far to much time processing information that could be fully automated. We can process information that exists all over the internet and obtain sensor input from all over the universe. Instead of re-centralizing or relocating all that information we can now adapt a new process to utilize it and optimize where it sits. Once we put everything in the cloud, retrieving it all at once becomes an impossible feat, even moving it around can become exceedingly difficult.\nWe now have much better understanding of our cognitive abilities and how we are built than we did a hundred years ago when they were developing the theories used in our current computing process flows. We didn't know what DNA was when the Univac was built, yet we still use this same fundamental architecture today.\nSelf-assembly, replication and identification are key ideas that DNA helps to handle in biology. We have the same needs for information. Information Theory taught us how the math works to communicate information, however, structuring it has led to countless debate.\nWe will be using a style of structuring based on Merkle DAGs and accessing them as Block Storage in a Metric Space.\n\nSeveral current theories take us from the single machine to the connected network, on to a truly distributed machine.  Most of us aren't interested in becoming theoretical mathematicians or computer scientists, let alone linquists and statisticians just to understand our budget. We need an easier way to connect everything, without being subject to vendorization or great cost. Those interested may dive deeply into the theories that make up a Composable Information Machine we offer a wealth of connected understanding for the theories presented in Docs.\n\nI want to own, understand, process and protect my information\n\nPersonal computers were supposed to be a tool for personal liberation, we achieved that. I now have dozens of computers in every room, data all over the internet and programming that goes back decades. Even though we have been talking about convergence for 30 years, we never achieved it.\nIt is now critical that we become able to understand our information and how it interacts with us and our environment.  We have achieved something extraordinary in the last 50 years of Information Technology. It became tiny and affordable to everyone. I can buy a $5 postage stamp sized computer that can do quite a bit of processing and it is widely available. The network is now ubiquitous with StarLink.\nWith some initial planning as to how we present and work with information we can come to an achievable whole greater than the sum of it's parts. \n\nIt needs to be made from readily accessible and available components which can all be identified, encapsulated and connected. \nIt needs to be able to grow and learn and use new technology and help us understand how to achieve it.\n\nThis means both hardware and software are completely identified, defined and related in a way we can predictably understand. We will know exactly how the machine works and how it communicates. The machine is a single entity as a whole, made from many parts, connected in an environment, residing in the known universe.\nA Composable Information Machine is a way to encapsulate information in a known, predictable manner in which we are in much more control of our global access to information. We now have a better ability to use it for making decisions that affect our lives rather than us being the sole machine to sort and access our information.\nWe need to cover structure, construction, types, power, networking, people, hardware and applications.  We assemble these definitions into a set of Composable Information Machines. The set is a fractal. There is really only one machine acting recursively on itself, but that is more difficult to comprehend at first.\nComposable Information Machine\n\nWe define an inventory system which, in turn, defines the informational limits and boundaries. We will combine many well-known services, yet see them as related and usable in very specific ways.\nWe can choose from many infrastructure resource modeling systems, the exact system is not important. We simply need a base that will act as the source of truth for our network. NetBox fulfills this for us nicely, if you need or want something else, you can use it. We fully expect NetBox to be replaced at some point so we start off expecting to plan for it.\nNext, where do I put it? Anywhere actually, this is a containerized system, in this guide we will start with a Raspberry Pi 4B for the initial system. We want to start simple and grow the machine organically as we need it. \n\nIt starts with a clone of the cim repository running the .devcontainer somewhere. You may do this on a laptop, on github, or anywhere else these docker containers are capable of running.\n\nWe will add clusters, cloud-services, racks of machines and many more containerized systems as we go. Expect whole systems to be replaced over time. This can easily be the biggest, fastest set of servers you want to put it on, we just don't require it. Start simple and scale.\nNetBox is designed to be a centralized single source of truth while a Composable Information Machine is distributed and partitioned. To accommodate this we will be making two significant adjustments to how we use NetBox. We extend NetBox to have a Write model as well as to use Event Sourcing.\nAbstracted interface to the network infrastructure model: \n\nRead Model from NetBox\nWrite Model (abstracted from same then optimized)\nEvent Sourcing\nProjections to create interaction and read model population\n\nWe will use the current NetBox data model as a READ Model for IRM. The Write Model is an abstraction we will create. We could abstract an API in Rust for our use with the Read Model, but there is one already built we can start from: rust-netbox.\nChanges to NetBox directly can be immediately supported with n8n. Writes will be sent to an Event Store with the API of NetBox and our Type System.\nProjections from the Event Store cause various actions (frequently modeled and tested in n8n to be performed based on the nature of the Event. Events are Strongly Typed and form a Type System used throughout the Composable Information Machine.\nLet's recap so far what we are doing.\nWe are building a Composable Information Machine\nWe require the following in order to do so:\n\n\nDefinition and Design\n\nStructure - Type System\nMapping and flow - n8n\ndocumentation - NetBox and git\nContent-Addressing - IPLD\n\n\n\nSoftware Defined Network\n\nrelationships of compute resources\nIPAM, VLAN, DNS, DHCP, VPN\nInventory - NetBox\n\n\n\nPower\n\nProviders\nSources and capabilities\n\nSolar\nWind\nGenerator\nGrid\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing Devices\n\nHardware and identification\nVirtual network endpoints\n\n\n\nDefinition of components\n\nWhat makes up a device\nSetting limits and boundaries for spaces\nContinuous integration and deployment\n\n\n\nSecure communication capability\n\nChannel between nodes\nCommand and control separation\nIdentity and Access Management\nFRP\n\n\n\nPersistance\n\nSystem of Record binding multiple Sources of Truth\nCommand, Query, Response Segregation + Event Sourcing\nContent-Addressing IPFS\naddressable blocks IPLD\n\n\n\nProofs\n\nProofs of operations\n\nHow does it work\n\n\nmonitoring\n\nShow me that it works\n\n\ncausality\n\nWhat made it do that\n\n\ngame theory\n\nWhat if it does this\n\n\n\n\n\n","description":"A distributed knowledge encapsulation system based on Functional Reactive Programming and Event Sourcing","id":"/articles/cim/","title":"Composable Information Machine"},"/authors/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"/authors/","title":""},"/authors/david/":{"body":"Vivamus in porta enim.

All this theory is peer-reviewed, academically practiced currently, and the focus of several ways of deeply seeing the universe in new and different perspectives using modern science.\nWe attempt to abstract it away so that it is there, but not in our face all the time. Anytime you wish to dive into these theories, such as Compositional Game Theory, Infinite Categories or Homotopy Type Theory, there are relative links everywhere throughout this machine. You will see academic theory coming from Cambridge, MIT, Harvard, Nottingham, Lund and many other well-known institutes of advanced learning.\nComposable Information Machine removes the unknown progressively through abstracted evolutionary concepts. Difficult material is usable and trustable, yet not always fully formed. We expect to continuously refine any machine we create and expect an integral feedback mechanism to do so. This system is able to learn, it is in fact, based on how your brain works. We learn things by reference, or pointing. We use this principle to derive Conceptual Spaces which allow us to relate many-to-many-to-many relationships is a mathematically reasonable way.\nCreating a Composable Information Machine should be a pleasant experience that helps us to better understand our information and the environments that envelope it. This is a matter of encapsulation and creation so that independent systems have an ability to interact with each other in predictable and automated ways. We follow a set of constraints and boundaries that seek to eliminate states and behaviors we don't want to be possible within our machine.\nSelf-organization is a vital aspect to this strategy.

It has been used for high-speed storage and retrieval of fixed content, such as documents stored for compliance with government regulations. Content-addressable storage is similar to content-addressable memory.\nCAS systems work by passing the content of the file through a cryptographic hash function to generate a unique key, the \"content address\". The file system's directory stores these addresses and a pointer to the physical storage of the content. Because an attempt to store the same file will generate the same key, CAS systems ensure that the files within them are unique, and because changing the file will result in a new key, CAS systems provide assurance that the file is unchanged.\nCAS became a significant market during the 2000s, especially after the introduction of the 2002 Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act which required the storage of enormous numbers of documents for long periods and retrieved only rarely. Ever-increasing performance of traditional file systems and new software systems have eroded the value of legacy CAS systems, which have become increasingly rare after roughly 2018. However, the principles of content addressability continue to be of great interest to computer scientists, and form the core of numerous emerging technologies, such as peer-to-peer file sharing, cryptocurrencies, and distributed computing. \n\nWikipedia\n\n\nContent-Addressable Memory\nContent-addressable memory (CAM) is a special type of computer memory used in certain very-high-speed searching applications. It is also known as associative memory or associative storage and compares input search data against a table of stored data, and returns the address of matching data.\nCAM is frequently used in networking devices where it speeds up forwarding information base and routing table operations. This kind of associative memory is also used in cache memory. In associative cache memory, both address and content is stored side by side. When the address matches, the corresponding content is fetched from cache memory.\n\nWikipedia\n\nContent-Addressable Network\nThe content-addressable network (CAN) is a distributed, decentralized P2P infrastructure that provides hash table functionality on an Internet-like scale.

As humans, we are pattern matching machines, we categorize, collect and sort naturally in our mind.\nI want an aggregated abstraction that lets me reason about things in very broad terms. Something like account or organization or myself. How do I reason about all the relationships between these things with certainty, with the power to evolve, replicate and emerge clear understanding we have not had before.
